# SECURITY POLICY

## Supported Versions

When a new **minor** version (`9.8.x`) is released, the previous one will continue to receive security fixes for *3 more months*.

When a new **major** version is released (`6.0`, `7.0`, etc), the previous stable release remains supported for *6 more months* through patches and security fixes.

(This policy may change in the future and exceptions may be made on a case-by-case basis.)
